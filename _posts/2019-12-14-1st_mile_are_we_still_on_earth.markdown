Flatiron School was unavoidable for me, in a great way. From countless advertisements to vast research on which bootcamp to choose, I always found myself coming across Flatiron. Software engineering always drew my interest but always felt too foreign to ever get into. I was always fascinated by the idea of building out things via code. From apps, to websites to software, I was always interested in understanding how these complex things were built and maintained. I finally gave into the interest and tried to learn a language to get into this world. Learning has been rewarding and more often than not, frustrating. Ive gotten used to the feeling of being stuck and as a result become more comfortable with working through things. The feeling of frustration is still overwhelmingly prevalent but hopefully in time it'll start going away. This is the first of many blog posts I assume so heres to hoping by the next blog post I'll be more comfortable in this foreign planet software engineering.
